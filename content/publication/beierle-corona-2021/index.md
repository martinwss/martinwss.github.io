abstract: Physical and mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is typically
  assessed via surveys, which might make it difficult to conduct longitudinal studies
  and might lead to data suffering from recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment
  (EMA) driven smartphone apps can help alleviate such issues, allowing for in situ
  recordings. Implementing such an app is not trivial, necessitates strict regulatory
  and legal requirements, and requires short development cycles to appropriately react
  to abrupt changes in the pandemic. Based on an existing app framework, we developed
  Corona Health, an app that serves as a platform for deploying questionnaire-based
  studies in combination with recordings of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present
  the technical details of Corona Health and provide first insights into the collected
  data. Through collaborative efforts from experts from public health, medicine, psychology,
  and computer science, we released Corona Health publicly on Google Play and the
  Apple App Store (in July 2020) in eight languages and attracted 7290 installations
  so far. Currently, five studies related to physical and mental well-being are deployed
  and 17,241 questionnaires have been filled out. Corona Health proves to be a viable
  tool for conducting research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and can serve as a
  blueprint for future EMA-based studies. The data we collected will substantially
  improve our knowledge on mental and physical health states, traits and trajectories
  as well as its risk and protective factors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic
  and its diverse prevention measures.
