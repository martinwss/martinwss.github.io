abstract: To slow down the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, countries worldwide severely
  restricted public and social life. In addition to the physical threat posed by the
  viral disease (COVID-19), the pandemic also has implications for psychological well-being.
  Using a small sample (N = 51), we examined how Big Five personality traits relate
  to coping with contact restrictions during three consecutive weeks in the ﬁrst wave
  of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We showed that extraversion was associated
  with suffering from severe contact restrictions and with beneﬁting from their relaxation.
  Individuals with high neuroticism did not show a change in their relatively poor
  coping with the restrictions over time, whereas conscientious individuals seemed
  to experience no discomfort and even positive feelings during the period of contact
  restrictions. Our results support the assumption that neuroticism is a vulnerability
  factor in relation to psychological wellbeing but also show an inﬂuence of contact
  restrictions on extraverted individuals.
