abstract: Background Depression and fatigue are commonly observed sequelae following
  viral diseases such as COVID-19. Identifying symptom constellations that differentially
  classify post-COVID depression and fatigue may be helpful to individualize treatment
  strategies. Here, we investigated whether self-reported post-COVID depression and
  post-COVID fatigue are associated with the same or different symptom constellations.
  Methods To address this question, we used data from COVIDOM, a population-based
  cohort study conducted as part of the NAPKON-POP platform. Data were collected in
  three different German regions (Kiel, Berlin, Würzburg). We analyzed data from textgreater2000
  individuals at least six months past a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease, using elastic
  net regression and cluster analysis. The regression model was developed in the Kiel
  data set, and externally validated using data sets from Berlin and Würzburg. Results
  Our results revealed that post-COVID depression and fatigue are associated with
  overlapping symptom constellations consisting of difficulties with daily activities,
  perceived health-related quality of life, chronic exhaustion, unrestful sleep, and
  impaired concentration. Confirming the overlap in symptom constellations, a follow-up
  cluster analysis could categorize individuals as scoring high or low on depression
  and fatigue but could not differentiate between both dimensions. Limitations The
  data presented are cross-sectional, consisting primarily of self-reported questionnaire
  or medical records rather than biometric data. Conclusions In summary, our results
  suggest a strong link between post-COVID depression and fatigue, highlighting the
  need for integrative treatment approaches.
