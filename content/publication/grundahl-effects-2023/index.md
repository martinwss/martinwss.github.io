abstract: Social buffering, a phenomenon where social presence can reduce anxiety
  and fear-related autonomic responses, has been studied in numerous laboratory settings.
  The results suggest that the familiarity of the interaction partner influences social
  buffering while also providing some evidence for gender effects. In the laboratory,
  however, it is difficult to mimic the complexity of real-life social interactions.
  Consequently, the social modulation of anxiety and related autonomic responses in
  everyday life remains poorly understood. We used smartphone-based Ecological Momentary
  Assessment (EMA) combined with wearable electrocardiogram sensors to investigate
  how everyday-life social interactions affect state anxiety and related cardiac changes
  in women and men. On five consecutive days, 96 healthy young participants (53% women)
  answered up to six EMA surveys per day, indicating characteristics of their most
  recent social interaction and the respective interaction partner(s). In women, our
  results showed lower heart rate in the presence of a male interaction partner. Men
  showed the same effect with female interaction partners. Moreover, only women showed
  decreased heart rate and increased heart rate variability with increasing interaction
  partner familiarity. These findings specify the conditions under which social interactions
  reduce anxiety-related responses in women and men.
