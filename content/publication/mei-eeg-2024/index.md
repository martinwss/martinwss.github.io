abstract: Previous research on racial ingroup bias in empathy for pain focused on
  neural responses to a single person’s suffering. It is unclear whether empathy for
  simultaneously perceived multiple individuals’ pain (denoted as collective empathy
  in this study) is also sensitive to perceived racial identities of empathy targets.
  We addressed this issue by recording electroencephalography from Chinese adults
  who responded to racial identities of 2 × 2 arrays of Asian or White faces in which
  4 faces, 1 face, or no face showed painful expressions. Participants reported greater
  feelings of others’ pain and their own unpleasantness when viewing 4 compared to
  1 (or no) painful faces. Behavioral responses to racial identities of faces revealed
  decreased speeds of information acquisition when responding to the face arrays with
  4 (vs. 1 or no) painful expressions of Asian (but not White) faces. Moreover, Asian
  compared to White face arrays with 4 (vs. 1 or no) painful expressions elicited
  a larger positive neural response at 160–190 ms (P2) at the frontal/central electrodes
  and enhanced alpha synchronizations at 288–1,000 ms at the central electrodes. Our
  findings provide evidence for racial ingroup biases in collective empathy for pain
  and unravel its relevant neural underpinnings.
