abstract: Background Although exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety
  disorders has frequently been proven effective, only few studies examined whether
  it improves everyday behavioral outcomes such as social and physical activity. Methods
  126 participants (85 patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder,
  or specific phobias, and 41 controls without mental disorders) completed smartphone-based
  ambulatory ratings (activities, social interactions, mood, physical symptoms) and
  motion sensor-based indices of physical activity (steps, time spent moving, metabolic
  activity) at baseline, during, and after exposure-based treatment. Results Prior
  to treatment, patients showed reduced mood and physical activity relative to healthy
  controls. Over the course of therapy, mood ratings, interactions with strangers
  and indices of physical activity improved, while reported physical symptoms decreased.
  Overall results did not differ between patients with primary panic disorder/agoraphobia
  and social anxiety disorder. Higher depression scores at baseline were associated
  with larger changes in reported symptoms and mood ratings, but smaller changes in
  physical activity Conclusions Exposure-based treatment initiates increased physical
  activity, more frequent interaction with strangers, and improvements in everyday
  mood. The current approach provides objective and fine-graded process and outcome
  measures that may help to further improve treatments and possibly reduce relapse.
