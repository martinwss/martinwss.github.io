abstract: A variety of factors contribute to the degree to which a person feels lonely
  and socially isolated. These factors may be particularly relevant in contexts requiring
  social distancing, e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic or in states of immunodeficiency.
  We present the Loneliness and Isolation during Social Distancing (LISD) Scale. Extending
  existing measures, the LISD scale measures both state and trait aspects of loneliness
  and isolation, including indicators of social connectedness and support. In addition,
  it reliably predicts individual differences in anxiety and depression. Data were
  collected online from two independent samples in a social distancing context (the
  COVID-19 pandemic). Factorial validation was based on exploratory factor analysis
  (EFA; Sample 1, N = 244) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Sample 2, N = 304).
  Multiple regression analyses were used to assess how the LISD scale predicts state
  anxiety and depression. The LISD scale showed satisfactory fit in both samples.
  Its two state factors indicate being lonely and isolated as well as connected and
  supported, while its three trait factors reflect general loneliness and isolation,
  sociability and sense of belonging, and social closeness and support. Our results
  imply strong predictive power of the LISD scale for state anxiety and depression,
  explaining 33 and 51% of variance, respectively. Anxiety and depression scores were
  particularly predicted by low dispositional sociability and sense of belonging and
  by currently being more lonely and isolated. In turn, being lonely and isolated
  was related to being less connected and supported (state) as well as having lower
  social closeness and support in general (trait). We provide a novel scale which
  distinguishes between acute and general dimensions of loneliness and social isolation
  while also predicting mental health. The LISD scale could be a valuable and economic
  addition to the assessment of mental health factors impacted by social distancing.
