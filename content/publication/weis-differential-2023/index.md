abstract: Abstract  Psychosocial factors affect mental health and health-related quality
  of life (HRQL) in a complex manner, yet gender differences in these interactions
  remain poorly understood. We investigated whether psychosocial factors such as social
  support and personal and work-related concerns impact mental health and HRQL differentially
  in women and men during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between June and
  October 2020, the first part of a COVID-19-specific program was conducted within
  the “Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure Stages A-B and Determinants of
  Progression (STAAB)” cohort study, a representative age- and gender-stratified sample
  of the general population of Würzburg, Germany. Using psychometric networks, we
  first established the complex relations between personal social support, personal
  and work-related concerns, and their interactions with anxiety, depression, and
  HRQL. Second, we tested for gender differences by comparing expected influence,
  edge weight differences, and stability of the networks. The network comparison revealed
  a significant difference in the overall network structure. The male ( N = 1370)
  but not the female network ( N = 1520) showed a positive link between work-related
  concern and anxiety. In both networks, anxiety was the most central variable. These
  findings provide further evidence that the complex interplay of psychosocial factors
  with mental health and HRQL decisively depends on gender. Our results are relevant
  for the development of gender-specific interventions to increase resilience in times
  of pandemic crisis.
