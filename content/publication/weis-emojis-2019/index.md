abstract: 'Emojis are nowadays a common substitute for real facial expressions to
  integrate emotions in social interaction. In certain contexts, emojis possibly could
  also transport information beyond emotions, reflecting interindividual differences
  or social aspects. In this study, we investigated the influence of emojis as socioemotional
  feedback stimuli on behavior and neural responses in a social decision game. We
  modified the Ultimatum Game by including emotional feedback provided by the proposer
  as response to the decision of the participant as receiver. Therefore, we generated
  identities that differed in their feedback behavior to identify differences in the
  processing of emotional feedback in a positive (acceptance) versus negative (rejection)
  frame. Regarding offer sizes, we replicated the valence effect of feedback-related
  negativity for small offer sizes evoking more negative brain potentials compared
  to larger ones. Further, we found an effect of affective emojis on distinct ERPs:
  A face-detecting neural component (N170) was examined to be a part of the processing
  of emojis, which resulted in significantly more negative amplitudes in response
  to a sad-looking emoji compared to smiling and neutral ones. Furthermore, P3 amplitudes
  indicate transmission effects from the feedback emoticons to the neural processing
  of different offer sizes. In contrast to previous findings, P3 responses of our
  subjects did not depend on the offer size, but rather by which kind of partner they
  were made. Since some evaluative processes did not reveal any effects, emojis seem
  to be less effective than real facial expressions, which convey more information
  that is socially meaningful.'
