abstract: Emotional feedback is a crucial part of social interaction, since it may
  indicate motivations, intentions, and thus, the future behavior of interaction partners.
  Nowadays, social interaction has been enriched by artificial emotional feedback
  provided by emojis, which are the means of transporting emotions in mobile messengers.
  In this study, we examined the influence of emotional feedback by emojis compared
  to real faces on decision-making and neural processing. We modified the ultimatum
  game by including proposers represented both by emojis and human faces who reacted
  specifically toward acceptance or rejection of an offer. We show that proposers
  who reward acceptance with a smile cause the highest acceptance rates. Interestingly,
  acceptance rates did not differ between proposers represented by humans compared
  to emojis. Regarding electrophysiology, emojis evoked more negative N170 and N2
  brain potentials compared to human faces both during a mere presentation and as
  feedback stimuli. Proposers that showed emotional facial expressions evoked larger
  N170 amplitudes as compared to neutral expressions. Especially the proposers represented
  by emojis evoked larger P3 amplitudes as feedback stimuli compared to human facial
  expressions. The comparison of emoji proposers with real-face proposers provides
  new insight into how relevant social cues influence behavior and its neural underpinnings.
