abstract: Background For decades, the nature of emotions has been at the center of
  psychological research, particularly regarding the underlying mechanisms that enable
  people to perceive, recognize, and process emotional stimuli. Research has indicated
  that there are interindividual differences in the processing of emotions. This includes
  age, which underlies neurological changes that contribute to the specific processing
  of emotions. Increasing age seems to be associated with a more positive evaluation
  of emotional information, from perception itself to attention, memory, and decision-making.Method
  The current study aimed to investigate whether these differences can be found in
  highly artificial emotional faces. Since emojis are representatives of emotional
  faces in digital communication, we selected a subset of 13 emojis and asked 170
  participants to evaluate them for their ability to represent different target emotions.Results
  An exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factorial structure with positive
  and negative valence for most of the ratings for the evaluated emojis. Furthermore,
  a multilevel model analysis based on the individual factor scores indicated higher
  age to be associated with an increase in factor scores for negative valence compared
  to positive valence.Conclusion In the present study, a trend for an age-specific
  positivity bias could only be shown in the classical smiley, while other emojis
  were related to negative valence with increasing age. Thus, we revealed age-related
  differences in emotion classification, even for highly artificial stimuli such as
  emojis.
