abstract: 'Background The influence of emotional feedback on social decision-making
  situations is an omnipresent part of social interaction. Complementing existing
  research on the impact of approach- and avoidance-related personality traits, we
  examined the role of sub-clinical depression and fear of negative social evaluation
  in a modified ultimatum game. Methods Different proposer identities reacted with
  distinct affective facial expressions to the acceptance and rejection of monetary
  offers in the ultimatum game. Facial expressions of proposers were relevant for
  depression and anxiety: A smile in response to acceptance or angry and sad feedback
  in response to rejection. Results People with higher symptoms of depression rejected
  more offers when the offer magnitude increased. Both, individuals with symptoms
  of depression and fear of negative evaluation approached sad feedback by rejecting
  more offers. At the neural level, positive emotional feedback (i.e., a smiling face)
  was linked to a reward positivity, which did not occur in participants with higher
  symptoms of depression. Limitations Since our paradigm implies a decision-dependent
  feedback pattern, the negative feedback might have been expected and was therefore
  not perceived as particularly relevant. Conclusions The results indicate specific
  behavioral as well as neural reaction patterns, which can be used especially for
  an initial subclinical identification of depression.'
