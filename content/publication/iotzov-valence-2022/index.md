abstract: Valence framing effects refer to inconsistent choice preferences in response
  to positive versus negative formulation of mathematically equivalent outcomes. Here,
  we manipulate valence framing in a two-alternative forced choice dictator game using
  gains and losses as frames to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying valence
  framing. We applied a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to examine whether gain (i.e.,
  “take” money) and loss (i.e., “give” money) frames evoke a cognitive bias as previous
  research did not consistently reveal framing effects using reaction times and response
  frequency as dependent variables. DDMs allow decomposing the decision process into
  separate cognitive mechanisms, whereby a cognitive bias was repeatedly associated
  with a shift in the starting point of the model. Conducting both a laboratory (N = 62)
  and an online study (N = 109), female participants allocated money between themselves
  and another person in a prosocial or selfish way. In each study, one group was instructed
  to give money (give frame), the other to take money (take frame). Consistent with
  previous studies, no differences were found in response times and response frequencies.
  However, in both studies, substantial bias towards the selfish option was found
  in the take frame groups, captured by the starting point of the DDM. Thus, our results
  suggest that valence framing induces a cognitive bias in decision processing in
  women, even when no behavioral differences are present.
