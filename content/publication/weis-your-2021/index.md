abstract: In everyday life, assumptions about our peers' as well as our own personality
  shape social interactions. We investigated whether self-rated personality and inferences
  drawn from partners' faces influence economic decisions. Participants (N = 285)
  played the trust game in the role of the trustor as well as the ultimatum game in
  the role of the proposer and interacted with trustees and receivers represented
  by prototypical personality faces. Participants also evaluated both their own traits
  and the personality of the faces. In the trust game, trustees represented by faces
  rated higher on agreeableness yielded higher transferred amounts. This effect was
  more pronounced for trustors low on dispositional trust, whereas trustors high on
  dispositional trust did not relate their decisions to the faces. Trustees represented
  by faces rated higher on conscientiousness yielded higher transferred amounts only
  for trustors high on dispositional anxiety. In the ultimatum game, receivers represented
  by faces rated higher on conscientiousness yielded lower offers only for proposers
  high on dispositional assertiveness. These results extend previous findings on the
  inferences drawn from facial features and the influence of personality on decision
  making. They highlight the importance of considering the personality of both interaction
  partner, as well as potential interactions of players' traits.
