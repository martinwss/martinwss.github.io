abstract: In human interactions, the facial expression of a bargaining partner may
  contain relevant information that affects prosocial decisions. We were interested
  in whether facial expressions of the recipient in the dictator game influence dictatorsâ€™
  behavior. To test this, we conducted an online study (n = 106) based on a modified
  version of a dictator game. The dictators allocated money between themselves and
  another person (recipient), who had no possibility to respond to the dictator. Importantly,
  before the allocation decision, the dictator was presented with the facial expression
  of the recipient (angry, disgusted, sad, smiling, or neutral). The results showed
  that dictators sent more money to recipients with sad or smiling facial expressions
  and less to recipients with angry or disgusted facial expressions compared with
  a neutral facial expression. Moreover, based on the sequential analysis of the decision
  and the interaction partner in the preceding trial, we found that decision-making
  depends upon previous interactions.
