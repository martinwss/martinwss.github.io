abstract: We investigated the influence of social status on behavior in a modified
  dictator game (DG). Since the DG contains an inherent dominance gradient, we examined
  the relationship between dictator decisions and recipient status, which was operationalized
  by three social identities and an artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we
  examined the predictive value of social dominance orientation (SDO) on the behavior
  of dictators toward the different social and non-social hierarchical recipients.
  A multilevel model analysis showed that recipients with the same status as the dictator
  benefited the most and the artificial intelligence the least. Furthermore, SDO,
  regardless of social status, predicted behavior toward recipients in such a way
  that higher dominance was associated with lower dictator offers. In summary, participants
  treated other persons of higher and lower status equally, those of equal status
  better and, above all, an algorithm worst. The large proportion of female participants
  and the limited variance of SDO should be taken into account with regard to the
  results of individual differences in SDO.
