abstract: Fairness norms and resulting behaviours are an important prerequisite for
  cooperation in human societies. At the same time, financial incentives are commonly
  used to motivate social behaviours, yet it remains unclear how financial incentives
  affect fairness-based behaviours. Combining a decision paradigm from behavioural
  economics with hierarchical drift-diffusion modelling, we investigated the effect
  of different financial incentives on two types of fairness-based decisions in four
  experimental groups. In two groups, participants divided points between themselves
  and a disadvantaged person, inciting fairness-based compensation behaviour, in two
  other groups they divided points between themselves and a fairness violator, inciting
  fairness-based punishment behaviour. In addition, each group received financial
  incentives that were either aligned or in conflict with the respective fairness-based
  behaviour. This design allowed us to directly investigate how different incentives
  shape the cognitive mechanism of fairness-based decisions and whether these effects
  are comparable across different fairness domains (fairness-based punishment versus
  fairness-based compensation). Results showed that offering conflicting incentives
  diminished fairness-congruent decision behaviour and rendered the fairness-congruent
  decision process less efficient. These findings demonstrate that financial incentives
  can undermine fairness-based behaviour, and thus are relevant for the development
  of incentive schemes aimed at fostering cooperative behaviour.
