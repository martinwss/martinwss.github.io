abstract: Greed, the insatiable and excessive desire and striving for more even at
  the expense of others, may be directed toward various goods. In this article, we
  propose that greed may be conceptualized as a domain-specific construct. Based on
  a literature review and an expert survey, we identified 10 domains of greed which
  we operationalized with the DOmain-SPEcific Greed (DOSPEG) questionnaire. In Study
  1 (N = 725), we found support for the proposed structure and convergent validity
  with related constructs. Bifactor-(S-1) models revealed that generic greed is differentially
  related to the greed domains, indicating that generic greed primarily captures a
  striving for money and material things. In the second study (N = 591), we found
  that greed domains had incremental validity beyond generic greed with regard to
  corresponding criteria assessed via self- and other-reports. We conclude that greed
  can be conceptualized as a domain-specific construct and propose an onion model
  reflecting this structure.
