abstract: Despite its negative reputation, egoism – the excessive concern for one’s
  own welfare – can incite prosocial behavior. So far, however, egoism-based prosociality
  has received little attention. Here, we first provide an overview of the conditions
  under which egoism turns into a prosocial motive, review the benefits and limitations
  of egoism-based prosociality, and compare them with empathy-driven prosocial behavior.
  Second, we summarize studies investigating the neural processing of egoism-based
  prosocial decisions, studies investigating the neural processing of empathy-based
  prosocial decisions, and the small number of studies that compared the neural processing
  of prosocial decisions elicited by the different motives. We conclude that there
  is evidence for differential neural networks involved in egoism and empathy-based
  prosocial decisions. However, this evidence is not yet conclusive, because it is
  mainly based on the comparison of different experimental paradigms which may exaggerate
  or overshadow the effect of the different motivational states. Finally, we propose
  paradigms and research questions that should be tackled in future research that
  could help to specify how egoism can be used to enhance other prosocial behavior
  and motivation, and the how it could be tamed.
