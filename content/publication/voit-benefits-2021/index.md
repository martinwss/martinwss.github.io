abstract: While there already is a huge body of research examining the advantages
  and disadvantages of physical attractiveness in social and economic decisions, little
  research has been made to explore the role of individual differences in social decision-making
  with regard to beauty. To close this scientific gap, we conducted a multiparadigm
  online study (N = 210; 52% females) in which participants were asked to make decisions
  in four different economic games facing differently attractive counterparts. Additionally,
  the personality trait agreeableness was assessed to test for individual differences
  in decision-making. In exploratory analyses, we also assessed which facet of agreeableness
  is the most appropriate to predict individual differences in the various economic
  games. In the study, we were able to replicate the finding of a beauty premium and
  a plainness penalty but did not find any support for the idea of a beauty penalty.
  Furthermore, evidence for an opposite-sex advantage was found, which was greater
  when men were facing women than the other way around. While agreeableness as an
  overall trait influenced decision making across various paradigms, interactions
  of distinct facets of agreeableness with the partners’ attractiveness remain heterogeneous
  and ambiguous. This underlines the importance of integrating the specificity of
  certain traits in experimental research and the necessity of combining them with
  different social situations.
