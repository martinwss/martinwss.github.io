abstract: Costly punishment describes decisions of an interaction partner to punish
  an opponent for violating rules of fairness at the expense of personal costs. Here,
  we extend the interaction process by investigating the impact of a socio-emotional
  reaction of the opponent in response to the punishment that indicates whether punishment
  was successful or not. In a modified Ultimatum game, emotional facial expressions
  of the proposer in response to the decision of the responder served as feedback
  stimuli. We found that both honored reward following acceptance of an offer (smiling
  compared to neutral facial expression) and successful punishment (sad compared to
  neutral facial expression) elicited a reward positivity, indicating that punishment
  was the intended outcome. By comparing the pattern of results with a probabilistic
  learning task, we show that the reward positivity on sad facial expressions was
  specific for the context of costly punishment. Additionally, acceptance rates on
  a trial-by-trial basis were altered according to P3 amplitudes in response to the
  emotional facial reaction of the proposer. Our results are in line with the concept
  of costly punishment as an intentional act following norm-violating behavior. Socio-emotional
  stimuli have an important influence on the perception and behavior in economic bargaining.
