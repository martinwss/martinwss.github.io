abstract: Background There is evidence that extraversion and associated frequent personal
  and digital social contacts are associated with mental health, reflected in reduced
  risk for anxiety or depression. However, excessive social media use (SMU) has been
  related to a decrease of mental health. We test how extraversion moderates the effect
  of SMU on anxiety and depression in times of social distancing. Methods Data were
  collected with an app-based survey combined with passive sensing of social media
  usage time. We analyzed SMU (objective average duration of communication app usage)
  and cross-sectional questionnaire data from 486 adults (mean age = 42.42). Using
  multiple regression models, we tested how SMU, extraversion and their interaction
  relate to individual depression and anxiety scores. Results Depression scores were
  associated with a higher SMU and lower extraversion. There was a significant positive
  relationship between SMU and extraversion that predicted higher depression scores.
  Limitations In the present sample, there is a recruitment bias since only data from
  smartphones running iOS were included. Future research should also take a closer
  look at the purpose behind SMU. Conclusions We conclude that extraversion might
  be a protective factor for depression which can turn into a harmful one if it is
  related to higher SMU. Thus, the interplay between SMU and extraversion needs to
  be considered when predicting individual differences in mental health.
