abstract: Altruistic punishment is the attempt to penalize deviant behavior of another
  person even though it is accompanied by personal costs. Here, we investigated the
  influence of the reaction on the socioemotional level of the other person following
  altruistic punishment behavior on future decision making and neural responses. We
  used a modified ultimatum game, which included an emotional facial feedback of the
  proposer following the decision of the participant. We found higher acceptance rates
  for proposers showing a smile upon acceptance or a sad face upon rejection of an
  offer, compared to proposers showing a neutral facial expression. On the neural
  level, we found a reversed N2 effect for negative emotional faces in the context
  of altruistic punishment, compared to a control condition. Specifically, when following
  the rejection of an unfair offer, negative emotional faces showed a reward-like
  positivity that might signal successful altruistic punishment. In addition, differential
  effects for P3 amplitudes might signal the subjective importance of a desired outcome.
  Our results are in line with the interpretation that rejection of unfair offers
  in the ultimatum game is due to intended altruistic punishment. Social cues may
  exhibit reward-like properties when indicating successful altruistic punishment
  and can influence subsequent decision making.
