abstract: Individuals have different preferences to interact with other persons. These
  preferences may vary depending on the personality of a person and the perceived
  personality of their interaction partner(s). Using ecological momentary assessment
  (EMA), we tested whether the perception of personality traits in others predicts
  participants’ preferences for social interactions in everyday life, and how these
  preferences are shaped by individual personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism,
  agreeableness) of the participants themselves. More specifically, we hypothesized
  that the preference to interact may increase if the interaction partner is perceived
  as extraverted and agreeable and may decrease if the other is perceived as scoring
  high on neuroticism. Based on mixed findings regarding preferences for similar vs. dissimilar
  personality profiles of interaction partners, we further expected interactions between
  participants’ personality and the interaction partners’ personality in relation
  to the preference to interact. To test these hypotheses, 130 participants answered
  up to six surveys on a smartphone on seven consecutive days. As predicted, higher
  levels of partner extraversion and agreeableness were related to increased preference
  to interact, while partner neuroticism showed the opposite effect. Similarly, participants
  scoring high on agreeableness showed higher and participants scoring high on neuroticism
  showed lower preferences to interact. Analyses regarding the interactions between
  the participants’ and the partners’ personality traits revealed that extraverts
  preferred other extraverts and agreeable individuals preferred interaction partners
  with perceived neuroticism. In conclusion, this study showed that the preference
  to interact with a person has a differential function depending on the personality
  traits of the interacting persons.
