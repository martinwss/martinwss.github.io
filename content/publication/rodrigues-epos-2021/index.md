abstract: BackgroundSince the replication crisis, standardization has become even
  more important in psychological science and neuroscience. As a result, many methods
  are being reconsidered, and researchersâ€™ degrees of freedom in these methods are
  being discussed as a potential source of inconsistencies across studies.New MethodWith
  the aim of addressing these subjectivity issues, we have been working on a tutorial-like
  EEG (pre-)processing pipeline to achieve an automated method based on the semi-automated
  analysis proposed by Delorme and Makeig.ResultsTwo scripts are presented and explained
  step-by-step to perform basic, informed ERP and frequency-domain analyses, including
  data export to statistical programs and visual representations of the data. The
  open-source software EEGlab in MATLAB is used as the data handling platform, but
  scripts based on code provided by Mike Cohen (2014) are also included.Comparison
  with existing methodsThis accompanying tutorial-like article explains and shows
  how the processing of our automated pipeline affects the data and addresses, especially
  beginners in EEG-analysis, as other (pre)-processing chains are mostly targeting
  rather informed users in specialized areas or only parts of a complete procedure.
  In this context, we compared our pipeline with a selection of existing approaches.ConclusionThe
  need for standardization and replication is evident, yet it is equally important
  to control the plausibility of the suggested solution by data exploration. Here,
  we provide the community with a tool to enhance the understanding and capability
  of EEG-analysis. We aim to contribute to comprehensive and reliable analyses for
  neuro-scientific research.
